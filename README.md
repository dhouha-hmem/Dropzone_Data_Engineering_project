### Challenge

Your task is to design the architecture for  a service where clients will be able to send their data via POST requests.
We want to see careful considerations of design. Examples include but are not limited to: scalability, security, automation, and data lineage/governance.
Think about these items and how you would approach implementing them. They should be included in your presentation
You don't need to implement them, but feel free to do so if time permits.

### Expectation
Please upload your solution (source code, scripts, resources,...) as well as your presentation into this Gitlab Repo at latest 24 hours before our interview meeting.

### Evaluation Criteria
The time allocation for this case is approximately eight hours. The assessment does not demand a perfect implementation; rather, the focus is on delivering a functional solution. Key evaluation points include:

* Structured and understandable presentation of your approach and system architecture
* Deployed implementation of the end-to-end dropzone service
* Your understanding of strengths and weaknesses of your solution
* Thoughtful use of modern and clean development practices
